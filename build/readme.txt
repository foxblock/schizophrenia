First of all, if you already played the game you probably noticed, if not here is a warning:
We completely ran out of time making this game, so it is a horrible unfinished mess.
Sorry about that.
There is some gameplay, but we had to cut quite a number of elements, animations, backgrounds and only finished 5 out of the planned 17 levels.
This does not mean we will leave the game in the state it currently is, we promise to keep working on it and at least finish the other 12 levels (and missing features).
Making this game was stressful (especially in the end), but also a lot of fun. 
Working in a team is much different from doing all on your own and you get to know the other person really well, which is a great experience.

We hope you like the game anyway and see the concept we had in mind.
Feel free to send us feedback it will help getting the rest done as fast as possible.

Thanks go to Uni for organizing the compeition, thanks to all the donators and sponsors, thanks to the other developers for filling this event with life and thanks to the communities who supported it and the developers in the process.
